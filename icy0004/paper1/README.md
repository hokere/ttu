# Latest Version of SPEAIT Paper1

## Completed steps:

- Created a google docs document to write article
- Moved all the data from the presentation slides to the document
- Wrote the article in google docs
- Learned some [LaTeX from WikiBooks][wblatex]
- Learned about CSL, the [Citation Style Language][csl]
- Learned about [Style guides][wikisguide] and [Abbreviations][wikisabbr]
- Searched for templates from [Overleaf][oleafsearch]
- Decided to use **IEEE Compsec Journal** style
- Wrote paper in overleaf and downloaded PDF

## Other methods I tried & Abandoned
- Use [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) and [Texlive](https://www.tug.org/texlive/): Too much work and not flexible
- Install R-Language and Studio and use it (too complex)
- Using https://stackedit.io/ to edit markdown: markdown still hard to write academic paper
- Using https://www.madoko.net/ to edit markdown and create LaTeX output: Creates unwanted brands
